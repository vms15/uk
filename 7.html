So why not express yourself with a new, UNIQUE phone case from Redbubble?</p> <p> <i> </i> Click here to see the #1 trending phone case <span> on Redbubble in November 2020.</span> </p> <p> But, of course, most of us want to protect our phones while being stylish. There&#8217;s nothing worse than dropping your phone and cracking the screen!!! </p> <p> Been there, done that (twice)!</p> <p> So that&#8217;s why I wrote this Redbubble phone case review, which covers both the iPhone cases and Samsung Galaxy cases. After reading 386 customer reviews, I summarized what they thought about the 3 styles of cases (snap, tough, and soft) in terms of both style and protection.</p> <p> This case is fantastic. The quality is very nice and durable, and the design on the back is vibrant, colorful, and well textured! </p> Cano on Oct 20, 2019 [RES] <p> <span> Quick Tip:</span> Even though a phone can still break while in a case, it&#8217;s less likely than if it didn&#8217;t have any protection at all. Adding a tempered glass screen protector (Amazon) can really help reduce the risk of breaking your phone even more!</p> <span> </span> Contents Snap Cases Quality of Print / Style Fit Quality of Material / Protection Tough Cases Quality of Print / Style Fit Quality of Material / Protection Soft Cases Quality of Print / Style Fit Quality of Material / Protection Where Do Redbubble Phone Cases Ship From? Conclusion: Redbubble Phone Case Review <h2> Snap Case</h2> <p> <i> </i> Click here to see the snap cases that are TRENDING RIGHT NOW on Redbubble! </p> <h3> Quality of Print / Style</h3> Click the image to see &#8220;Awesome Mix Vol. 1&#8221; by imnotahero on Redbubble. <p> Some customers mentioned that the print quality of the artwork was great. I can attest that the colors on these cases are vibrant and the print is sharp (unless the artist uploaded a crappy image, which rarely happens). From my 11+ years of shopping on Redbubble, I know that (usually) what you see is what you get.</p> <p> A nice touch is that the artwork wraps around the sides of the case and I absolutely love the smooth, glossy material (but a few people complained that they&#8217;d rather have a matte case with grip).</p> <p> Another nice thing about the case is that the print/artwork is actually embedded directly into the case. So, if you scratch the case, the artwork itself won&#8217;t get scratched off. It also means that the colors won&#8217;t fade, even after years of use.</p> <p> Over the years, I&#8217;ve heard people complain that these cases scratch easily. But, personally, I find that the tiny scratches on my Redbubble cases are only visible if I shine the light at a certain angle and I really look for it.</p> <p> Fits perfectly and lasts forever (I had used this brand for my old phone too, it got plenty of abuse and never broke or had the phone damaged). Plus I love the designs and even after three years in use the colours stayed strong. Great product!</p> Ulrike on Jun 23, 2019 [RES] <h3> Fit</h3> <p> All of the reviewers, except for one, said that the snap case fits very well on their phone. Once you snap it on your phone, it won&#8217;t fall off. But, the case is fairly easy to get on and off your phone.</p> <p> The one customer who complained about the case not fitting well said that it initially fit well but got looser over time.</p> <p> People also loved that the case doesn&#8217;t wrap around the top and bottom of the phone, so you have full access to ports. The case also makes it easy to access all the buttons on the side of the phone.</p> <p> I love the design and the feel. It has a super slim design but it still protects my phone screen without being super bulky. I would recommend this phone case to just about anyone.</p> John D. on Dec 21, 2019 [RES] <h3> Quality of Material / Protection</h3> Click the image to see &#8220;The Birches&#8221; by littleclyde on Redbubble. <p> Many customers said how much they liked how the snap case is very slim and lightweight but durable and sturdy. The case does not warp with use.</p> <p> However, out of the three types of Redbubble phone cases, the snap case is the least protective. It&#8217;s impact-resistant with a protective lip, but compared to the other two styles of phone cases on Redbubble, your phone is more likely to break if you drop it on the ground (the tough case provides the most protection).</p> <p> But that&#8217;s not to say that it WILL break </p> <p> There were numerous reviews of people saying they dropped their phones on hard floors, like cement, and their phone didn&#8217;t have any damage! That&#8217;s pretty impressive!</p> <p> However, one reviewer mentioned that they dropped their phone on tile and their case cracked. After this accident, their case was unable to fit on their phone. But I guess it&#8217;s better than their phone breaking.</p> <p> its really good quality case and image. durable too, dropped many times on hard floors and cement and my phone doesnt have any damage! </p> Kyle D. on Mar 20, 2019 [RES] Click the image to see the snap cases that are TRENDING RIGHT NOW on Redbubble! <p> And, unfortunately, another reviewer said that their phone broke 2 days after they got their snap case. This phone case is definitely not made for the super adventurer (or the clumsy like me). You&#8217;d be better off with a tough case .</p> <p> Another review that stuck out to me, and I thought would be important for me to share, was from a woman who owns a Samsung Galaxy S7 </p> <p> <i> </i> Click here to see the snap cases that are TRENDING RIGHT NOW on Redbubble! </p> <p> The only place for improvement would be the depth of the case. I don&#8217;t like that the camera lens touches any surface when I put my phone down and same for the front, if the edges were taller the glass wouldnt touch and surfaces when putting the phone down. Delivery was great too. Thanks! </p> Corrine H. on Mar 17, 2017 [RES] <p> No one with a tough case mentioned the problem above.</p> <p> These guys are wonderful I ordered the wrong size they made a new one- no charge, it fits great good price good quality quick turnaround time. I will always buy my cases from them this is my fourth!</p> Sara on Jan 3, 2020 [RES] <h2> Tough Case Review</h2> <p> <i> </i> Click here to see the iPhone cases that are TRENDING RIGHT NOW on Redbubble!</p> <h3> Quality of Print / Style</h3> Click the image to see &#8220;Nintendo Gameboy Pocket Classic&#8221; by ~ * on Redbubble. <p> Similar to the snap case, customers said that the print quality of the artwork was great. The colors are vibrant, the design is sharp, and the artwork wraps around the edges of the case.</p> <p> It appears to be made of the same smooth, glossy material and the same printing process as the snap case . The artwork is embedded directly into the case so the artwork won&#8217;t fade.</p> <p> Similar to the snap case, a few customers complained about the case scratching easily. Again, I personally find that the tiny scratches on my Redbubble tough case are only visible if I shine the light at a certain angle and I really look for it.</p> <h3> Fit</h3> <p> All of the reviewers said that the tough case was still very slim and fits very well on their phone. Once you snap it on your phone, it&#8217;s REALLY hard to get off!!!</p> <p> In a way, not being able to get the case off your phone is a good thing. It means that the case won&#8217;t fall off your phone when you drop it. On the other hand, if you like to change your case regularly, you&#8217;ll have a good fight on your hand!</p> <p> The case wraps around all the edges of your phone, so you have maximum protection. There&#8217;s still enough flexibility to the soft shell to get the edges of a tempered glass screen protector under it.</p> <p> This product is great. It’s durable, looks sleek, fits nicely on my phone, and is very personal and unique. I had the same kind of case for my iPhone 7 and it lasted 2 and a half years and I dropped it multiple times and the case held strong and protected my phone.</p> Jayden on Jun 1, 2019 [RES] <p> One thing to note is that, even though you have full access to ports, the headphone jack and charger port cut-outs are a bit small. it can make it difficult for headphones or chargers that aren&#8217;t small enough to fit the cutouts. For the same reason, I can&#8217;t use a selfie stick with my tough case on.</p> <p> You might also find that the tough case makes the power and volume buttons a bit stiff to press (but only 1 reviewer out of 212 complained about this).</p> <p> Even though there was a slight issue with the headphone port, the case didn&#8217;t affect the camera at all. So you don&#8217;t have to worry about taking blurry pictures.</p> <h3> Quality of Material / Protection</h3> Click the image to see &#8220;Space Cleaner&#8221; by RobertRichter on Redbubble. <p> Out of the three styles of cases, the sturdy tough case is the most popular and offers the most amount of protection. From the 212 reviews I&#8217;ve read about the tough case, it&#8217;s amazing how many times I&#8217;ve read about people dropping their phones multiple times and their phones were still OK!</p> <p> This style of case has a soft inner skin that wraps around your phone, and also has a durable, hard outer shell. The hard shell is supposed to protect the phone against the impact of a fall, while the soft shell is supposed to absorb the shock.</p> <p> The soft inner skin is big enough that if you drop your phone with the screen facing down, it will keep the screen from hitting the ground.</p> <p> This is definitely a sturdy, non-bulky case and I love it! I really feel like my phone is protected and, with MANY falls, my iPhone is still intact! I personally think it was worth the price.</p> <p> I did read one review where the person dropped their phone and the case cracked but the phone was undamaged. A case is cheaper than a phone! </p> <p> I couldn’t be without my iPhone Tough cases from RedBubble I’ve used them for the last 4 years and I LOVE them. They’re just excellent; the heights my phone has fallen from and I’m yet to break a phone. Or screen. My toddler constantly chucks my phone around and it protects it even then. The soft silicone inner gives great shock absorbency and I love having my favourite artwork on my phone (as well as on my wall). The artwork on the case doesn’t fade and is represented as accurately as in actual print. Couldn’t be happier. Please always make these cases!</p> Eleanor on Jun 12, 2019 [RES] <h2> Soft Case Review</h2> <p> <i> </i> Click here to see the soft cases that are TRENDING RIGHT NOW on Redbubble!</p> Click the image to see &#8220;Wise Words from The Office&#8221; by huckblade on Redbubble. <p> <span> Note:</span> Soft cases are only available for the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR.</p> <p> I only noticed that Redbubble had soft cases in April 2019. And, since I could only find 12 reviews about the soft case (and I haven&#8217;t bought one yet), it&#8217;s hard for me to write much of a review on this product.</p> <p> I will be updating this review as time goes on and I can collect more information about the soft case. But until then, this is the information I could gather </p> <h3> Quality of Print / Style</h3> <p> The big difference with the soft case is that it&#8217;s flexible, it&#8217;s frosty, and has an anti-fingerprint finish.</p> <p> Another thing to notice is that, even though reviewers said the quality of the print was great overall, the artwork is printed ON the surface of the case. This means that the print is not part of the material.</p> <p> Both the snap and tough cases have the artwork embedded directly into the case. So, I don&#8217;t know if this is going to affect the print after a long period of use. (Will have to wait and see).</p> <p> Another thing to note is that the artwork is printed on the front of the case, but not on the sides. The sides are left sem-transparent.</p> <p> I found the quality to be very good. I was impressed with the clarity of the design and look forward to showing my loyalty to Redbubble by purchasing future cases from them.</p> Craig on Dec. 29, 2019 [R E S] <h3> Fit</h3> <p> The case is made of a thin, flexible material that grips all around the edges of the phone. The buttons are covered with the case, but you still have access to ports.</p> <p> Customers said that the case is easy to slip on and off the phone. This case might be a great alternative to the tough case if you don&#8217;t drop your phone often and you really want to change the style of your phone case regularly.</p> <p> I’ve always been a fan of smaller less bulky cases and this one suits my preferences perfectly. It does it’s job and the design looks great.</p> William on Jan 2, 2020 [RES] <h3> Quality of Material / Protection</h3> <p> The reviewers mentioned that the case is very durable.</p> <p> But, even though the soft case can absorb the impact of a fall better than the snap case, I personally think that the tough case is still the clear winner when it comes to protection.</p> <p> I love the case and I’ve dropped my phone multiple times without a crack!! The design is printed very clearly and it’s a thin case, which is very nice to hold. Would order from here again!! </p> Hanna H. on May 27, 2019 [RES] <h2> Where Do Redbubble Phone Cases Ship From?</h2> <h3> Snap Cases &amp; Tough Phone Cases</h3> Shipped to From USA USA Canada Canada &amp; USA UK UK Europe UK Australia Australia New Zealand Australia <h3> Soft Phone Cases</h3> Shipped to From USA USA Canada USA UK UK &amp; USA Europe UK &amp; USA Australia Australia New Zealand Australia <p> Please visit Redbubble&#8217;s &#8220;Product Manufacturing Info&#8221; page for up-to-date information.</p> <h2> Conclusion: Redbubble Phone Case Review</h2> Click the image to see &#8220;Vintage Phone case&#8221; by MalvadoPhD on Redbubble. <p> While reading all of these reviews, I noticed that a lot of people said they had a Redbubble phone case for years, and when they got a new phone, they bought another case from Redbubble. That&#8217;s proof that people love and trust these cases. </p> <p> Personally, if I were to buy a case right now, I would really buy the tough case because I&#8217;m really clumsy and I drop everything (I&#8217;ll never be a surgeon).</p> <p> However, I&#8217;m really interested in the soft case because you could interchange the cases easily and it supposedly absorbs the impact of a fall. I would just want to wait a little longer so that I can read more customer reviews on the soft case before I buy one. I&#8217;m WAY too clumsy to buy one without further research.</p> <p> I will never purchase another type of case from anywhere else. They are sturdy, fashionable, and all of the [ports] have easy access. I like that I can choose from thousands of designs, And I like that if the art does not come out correctly the company Stands behind it. The shipping is fast and the customer service is top notch.</p> Jenefier on May 30, 2019 [RES] <p> <i> </i> Click here to see the phone cases that are TRENDING RIGHT NOW on Redbubble!</p> <p> So go ahead and find Redbubble phone cases that are uniquely you, support independent artists, and (most importantly) HAVE FUN shopping!</p> <p> Resources:</p> <p> All customer reviews featured on this page were taken from Redbubble&#8217;s customer review section.
